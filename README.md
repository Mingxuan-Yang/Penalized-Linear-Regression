# STA 523 :: Project

This is our group final project on **Penalized Linear Regression**. 

Group members: Bo Liu, Mingxuan Yang, Jiawei Chen, Linlin Li.

### How to evaluate

You can use `make` to generate files you will need and launch the app.

There might be an error "This site canâ€™t be reached. 127.0.0.1 refused to connect.", which is because the webpage is opened before the set-up of the shiny app. You can refresh the webpage or just wait a couple of seconds.

Three sample data files are under `/Data` folder. One of them is `monthly_stock.csv`, which we use API to download from online source.

### Attention

- For regression part, when you use the automatic formula-generating system, please delete what you've written in the formula input. Otherwise, it will still use your formula input.

- If there is an error "address already in use" when executing `make`, it is because the port selected is currently occupied. Since we choose one out of 5000 port numbers randomly each time, the problem will likely to disappear for the next port number.

- If the webpage fails to pop out after `make`, you can open the browser and log in onto http://127.0.0.1:xxxx, where xxxx is the port number stored in port.txt. The webpage may fail to pop out because of security settings.

### Topics covered

- Basic R calculation, functions and plots;

- Advanced plots using `ggplot2`;

- S3 objects and generic programming;

- Useful data manipulating packages like `dplyr` and `purrr`;

- Efficient data I/O packages like `readr`;

- Web scraping and API interface, and manipulating scraped texts using `jsonlite`;

- Platform accustomed Makefile with variables;

- RShiny app;

- HighChart object for interactive plots.
