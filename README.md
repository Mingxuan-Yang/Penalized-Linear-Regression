# STA 523 :: Project

You can use `make` to generate files you will need and launch the app.

There might be an error "This site canâ€™t be reached. 127.0.0.1 refused to connect.", which is because the webpage is opened before the set-up of the shiny app. You can refresh the webpage or just wait a couple of seconds.

Three sample data files are under `/Data` folder.

### Attention

- For regression part, when you use the automatic formula-generating system, please delete what you've written in the formula input. Otherwise, it will still use your formula input.
